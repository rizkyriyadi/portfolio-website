Technical Implementation Guide
For Your Next.js + Tailwind Setup:
Key Libraries to Add:
- Framer Motion (for complex animations)
- GSAP with ScrollTrigger (for scroll animations)
- Lenis (for butter-smooth scrolling)
- SplitType (for text animations)
- React Intersection Observer (for viewport detection)
Animation Principles to Follow:

The 60fps Rule: Every animation must be GPU-accelerated
Stagger Everything: Elements should cascade in, not appear all at once
Ease With Purpose: Use custom bezier curves, not default eases
Loading as Theater: Make the initial load an experience, not a wait

Specific Improvements for Each Section:
Hero Section (RIZKY RIYADI)

Animate each letter with a slight rotation and scale on load
Add a subtle turbulence effect to the text on hover
Create a "breathing" effect with opacity and scale
Implement a liquid-like transition when navigating away

About Section

Text should fade in word-by-word as you scroll
Skills should animate in with staggered timing
Add a subtle parallax effect to the background
Status indicator should pulse gently

Experience Section

Timeline elements should draw themselves in
Content should slide in from alternating sides
Dates should count up when they come into view
Add subtle hover states that expand the content

Work Section

Projects should load with a cinematic reveal
Implement a smooth filtering system with morphing transitions
Add preview animations on hover (not just static images)
Create seamless transitions to project details

The "Whoa" Checklist:
✓ First 3 Seconds Rule: Something unexpected must happen immediately
✓ Scroll Surprise: Each scroll should reveal something delightful
✓ Cohesive Motion: All animations should feel part of the same family
✓ Performance: Must maintain 60fps even with all animations
✓ Purposeful: Every animation should enhance, not distract
Sample Animation Sequence for Hero:
1. Background subtly shifts color/gradient
2. Letters fade in one by one with slight upward motion
3. Subtitle appears with a typewriter effect
4. Navigation elements slide in from edges
5. A subtle particle system or geometric shapes float in background
6. All elements have micro-movements on idle
Final Touch - The Emotional Layer:
Studio Nordost succeeds because their animations tell a story. Your animations should:

Create anticipation (subtle loading states)
Reward exploration (hidden interactions)
Feel premium (smooth, considered timing)
Be memorable (one signature animation that defines your site)
